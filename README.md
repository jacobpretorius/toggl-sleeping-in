# toggl-sleeping-in

This "function" (script) is meant to be run daily on [webtask.io](https://webtask.io/) to start a "sleeping in" timer you have.

See [https://jcpretorius.com/post/2018/automatically-sync-fitbit-workouts-to-toggl](https://jcpretorius.com/post/2018/automatically-sync-fitbit-workouts-to-toggl) for a guide how to setup webtask scheduler, modules and secrets.
